The goal of this thesis was to determine whether a simple model with a flavour group and a minimal set of particles added to the Standard Model 
could explain some odd issues in flavour physics and cosmology. One thing are the hierarchies of quark masses, quark mixing and neutrino mixing
which are handled by a continuous $U(1)_\text{FN}$ under which the fermions are charged in such a way that particularly the quark sector gets
its observed mass and mixing structure. The small discrete group $Z_3$ distinguishes the charged lepton from the neutrino sector so that another
discrete group $A_4$ can take care of the patterns of neutrino oscillation and also give the muon a special role. This is needed to adress the 
second issue, the 
flavour anomalies encountered in $B$-meson processes where a muon is involved and the anomalous magnetic moment of itself $(g-2)_\mu$. These 
processes are
mediated by three new particles. At first, one colorless, only weakly charged fermion whose quantum numbers are chosen such that there exists one 
electrically uncharged state in the isospin multiplet, meaning that it can be a Majorana fermion. Furthermore, this fermion is the lightest of the
new particles and its stability is protected by an additional $U(1)_\chi$ under which they all are oddly charged while the Standard Model particles 
are even. The other two particles are scalars, one carrying lepton number, the other baryon number so that no violations of these two quantum numbers
are induced. With two new particles and one from the Standard Model, they mediate the just mentioned processes with a chiral interaction. 
The third issue targeted here,
is the assumed presence of dark matter in the universe which makes up a way bigger part of the mass distribution therein. A lot of hints point
at a weakly interacting massive particle, just as our new lightest fermion state, to constitute the majority of this obscure matter. \\
\noindent So the principal task was to examine the contributions to the flavour processes coming from new physics on the one hand and verify
with the constraints obtained there whether the lightest new fermion state meets the conditions coming from its assumed density in space and
its interaction with nuclei on earth on the other hand. We did this for two isospin representations of the fermion, either a singlet or a
triplet while both carry no other Standard Model charge. Another article \cite{Grip}, where this model was invented, suggests a dark matter candidate having
a high hypercharge. The advantage was that their charge assignment covers all flavour anomalies, especially the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon 
but unfortunately the dark matter candidate had a too high interaction with nuclei so that it already should have been detected. Our modification 
also explains the 
$B$-anomalies but only a fraction of $\Delta a_\mu$. The advantage here, however, is that a Majorana particle as lightest particle is not yet
excluded in this framework with a mass on the weak scale, leaving it to be a viable dark matter candidate. But even though both representations 
can fit the $B$-anomalies and the relic density of dark matter, many models can achieve this. The main question is, whether direct detection 
experiments will eventually rule them out or not. While the nucleon scattering cross section for singlet dark matter is still far below current bounds,
the triplets will be examined in the near future.\\
\noindent Besides the improvement of direct detection measurements it will also be interesting to follow up new constraints from the flavour 
sector and see in what way they can direct the dark matter properties. On the part of dark matter phenomenology we presented only leading order
terms with analytical expressions. It might be worth to cross-check the results with numerical calculations provided by \texttt{DarkSUSY} 
\cite{0406204} or \texttt{micrOMEGAs} \cite{1005.4133} among others.
